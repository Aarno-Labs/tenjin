N.B. Tenjin is still extremely early stage; these are mostly a placeholder.

## Translation

```
$ 10j translate --codebase <PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIRECTORY> --resultsdir <WHATEVER>
```

The `resultsdir` will contain a series of codebase copies as it undergoes
various transformations during translation. The final version of the code
will be contained in a subdirectory called `final/`.
