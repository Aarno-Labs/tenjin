# This file contains macro names for which expansion is stopped during
# Tenjin's translation. For now we are simply assuming that the macros
# being referenced are the standard ones. In theory a program could
# avoid including <ctype.h> and instead define their own version of
# `isblank` with a different definition of blank characters than the
# standard definition. We could address that case by requiring a
# definition to originate via a particular file name.
